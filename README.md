## Features

- Create, read, update, and delete notes
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- User-specific notes management

## Technologies Used

- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing notes and user data.
- **Express.js**: Web framework for building the server-side application.
- **React**: Frontend library for creating a dynamic user interface.
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for executing server-side code.
- **Mongoose**: ODM library for MongoDB and Node.js.
- **Axios**: Promise-based HTTP client for making requests from React to the API.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: For secure user authentication.

## Installation

To set up the Notes Manager application locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mern-notes-manager.git
   cd mern-notes-manager
   ```

2. **Install server dependencies**:
   ```bash
   cd server
   npm install
   ```

3. **Install client dependencies**:
   ```bash
   cd ../client
   npm install
   ```

4. **Set up environment variables**:
   Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory and add your MongoDB connection string:
   ```
   MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
   ```

5. **Start the server**:
   ```bash
   cd server
   npm start
   ```

6. **Start the client**:
   Open a new terminal window and run:
   ```bash
   cd client
   npm start
   ```

Your application should now be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

2. Sign up for a new account or log in with an existing account.
3. Start creating, editing, and managing your notes!
